# AR Nutrition Scanner
![Logo](https://github.com/alexding123/augmented_nutrition_scanner/blob/master/Augmented%20Nutrition%20Scanner/Assets/Resources/Sprites/LogoColored.png)
In this project, we are visualizing nutritional values of foods with AR by scanning barcodes. Barcode recognition is done using the `ZXing` library, and UPC (barcode) searches are done with `Nutritionix`, with a free API account (hence the 50 UPC searches per day limit). 

The app is built in Unity, for IOS. 

## Usage
The build is under `Augemented Nutrition Scanner/Release`. Open it up with Xcode and build it onto your phone (with `append` option in Unity). 

## Context
This app is developed in a summer camp in NuVu Studios by Alex Ding and Andrew Chen, July 24th - August 4th, 2017, with the help of NuVu staffs. More updates (may) come after the summercamp has ended.
