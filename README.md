# AR Nutrition Scanner
![Logo](http://imgur.com/a/e5bHr)
In this project, we are visualizing nutritional values of foods with AR by scanning barcodes. Barcode recognition is done using the `ZXing` library, and UPC (barcode) searches are done with `Nutritionix`, with a free API account (hence the 50 UPC searches per day limit). 

The app is built in Unity, for IOS. 

## Project Page
Visit the [portfolio page](https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/studios/augmented-health/augmented-nutrition-scanner#tab-portfolio) of the project. 

## Usage
Download the repository, open it up in Unity, build the project with scene `PopUp` open under IOS settings, and open it up with Xcode to build onto your phone. 

## Context
This app is developed in a summer camp in NuVu Studios by Alex Ding and Andrew Chen, July 24th - August 4th, 2017, with the help of NuVu staffs. More updates (may) come after the summercamp has ended.
